=== Runtime View

[NOTE]
====
This documentation is intended for developers and architects to help them understand how the application has been implemented and the functions implemented in each component and how the components interact.

This document should contain Sequence diagrams to show the sequence of events to implement a particular feature. It should also contain state diagrams, if pertinent, to show the different states of information in the processes.

It can contain any other details (class diagrams, ERM and more) which would help a developer understand the system. The deployment is described in the deployment view
