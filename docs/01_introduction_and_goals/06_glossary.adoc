=== Glossary


////
The glossary explains terminology and allows to reference acronyms easily. Copy the `Link` example and paste it in your document to create a link to the glossary entry. Alternatively, you can `search and replace` the `terms` once in a while to make sure they are referenced. It is the responsibility of the reviewer to make sure terms are referenced correctly
