=== Monitoring and Logging
[NOTE]
====
Add any design decision on how monitoring and logging is done and where the logs are kept and for how long

- Centralized logging using the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization
- Automated alerting system for critical issues
- Detail the appropriate logging solution for you library and framework e.g. `log4j`
- Describe the dashboards which allow to monitor the application. e.g. Prometeus and Grafana and how they are set up and the data that is presented
