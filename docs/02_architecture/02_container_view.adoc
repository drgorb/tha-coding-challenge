=== Description of Modules and Components

==== Web Application

[NOTE]
Describe the design choices made for the web application. Framework (e.g. React, Angular) and other technical decisions. The features of the application are described elsewhere.

==== API Gateway

[NOTE]
Describe how the Web App interacts with the gateway, what the security or trust parameters are and other design choices.

==== Other components

[NOTE]
Describe why the components are required (e.g. Hexagonal architecture mandates separation of function and persistence) and what their main function is.
